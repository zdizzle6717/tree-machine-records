        "text": "Austin Bey's debut album, Treated, is an 8 track EP that reveals a hard earned melancholy and an unwavering desire to express true pain.  The album was written in the hospital while recovering from being hit by a car, and it was recorded shortly after returning home.  His previous work was more focused on the role of producing other artists, and this time he wanted to create something that was his own vision. Born in an area of Baltimore where rap reigned supreme over all other genres of music, Austin found himself the oddball in his neighborhood and school for deciding to branch off into other musical realms. Having produced rap music for years, Austin was bored and unhappy with the music he’s made; wanting something more out of the talents he had acquired over time.  Some of the tracks aren't rap at all, but more of a soulful storytelling.  This is Austin Bey.",

Lush 80's synth takes you back in time and returns a feeling of easy living, lemonade, and poolside weather. Get acquainted with the kookie electronics and synth rhythms, and break away from the monotony of routine. Don't be just another number in the system.

He admires multi-instrumentalist Todd Rundgren for his work as a producer and his soulful writing. He also mentions his friends and spiritual fathers, the members of french touch band Mellow, who passed on to him a true passion for production. And eventually Syd matters band leader Jonathan Morali with whom he shared ten intense years on the road. His debut 6 track record 'WipeOut!' is a colorful collection of songs that lead Rémi to confront himself musically, and apply his production skills to a personal project. The production is condensed, precise, focused on groove and melody, with an ambition to move listeners, as well as make them move. Behind his intricate writing lies pure stylistic freedom, and a will to brake all aesthetic and conceptual barriers. This ep was written and recorded as spontaneously as possible to avoid getting lost in long and complicated thought process. Shorebilly composes a singular and sincere music fit for all sensibilities, a hectic yet organic soundscape where pop and electronic music collide. Rémi Alexandre constantly pumps life and emotion into a synthetic universe of his own creation. This passionate and thin-skinned workaholic has decided to surf his own wave and 'Wipeout!' is his declaration of love for music.",

In case you’re on mobile, the link leads you to a giant looping gif with some colored balls that blob around when you move your mouse. WOOF’s music is as colorful as the accompanying gifs – jangly guitars, lackadaisical vocals, drums absolutely drenched in reverb. It’s a pretty fun bit of HTML, and an interesting way to supplement (subvert?) the music video. If WOOF’s music was a dog, it’d probably materialize into something like the above photo: friendly, loyal, chill as fuck but still kind of sassy. His music paws the line (these puns are killing me) between digital and analog. Though 'Faultline' is more guitar based, many of the tracks on Bad Connection use MIDI and samples. The music sounds sonically comfy, but it’s clear that there is a huge amount of work put in, since Bonislawski himself arranges and plays all the instruments – kind of like a deconstructed band.' - No Smoking Media",

        "text": "'Guitar-centric bands obsessed with reverb are a dime a dozen. Sure, there are variations to the sound that still surprise, but they’re getting harder and harder to find. While Living Hour’s self-titled may not necessarily be a monumental leap forward for this style of music, its charm is found in dialing back to the past for inspiration, rather than trying to invent the newest, most futuristic sound. Instead of trying to hop on the super-hip train along with bands such as DIIV or Beach Fossils, Living Hour’s music reaches way further back than the late ‘70s for inspiration. It has a quality much more akin to the lazy, balladic guitar moments of the late ‘50s and early ‘60s. The music here possesses a hazy quality more partial to old school guitar standards such as Santo and Johnny’s “Sleep Walk” than anything of the more post-punk or shoegaze stripe. Right from the get-go, with “Summer Song,” minimalism is the order of the day, and it’s a decision that pays off. Best Coast might have dibs on the surf-rock-on-Xanax sound these days, but it’s refreshing to hear another band pull it off with such gusto.' - Paste Magazine",

The rest, as they say, is history. Recently in receipt of a debut, self-titled EP, WOOF is now on a mission to reignite his chosen genre. Think Beck taking a turn at the subterranean pop scene, or Pillar Point acting a little more mainstream; this is exactly the kind of music in with a chance of making it onto Radio One’s A-list, simply for being cool.

People gathered for a night of musical celebration at Swan Dive but were not quite prepared for the face melting that would ensue. Ohhh yes. That is right. This extended play is packed with groovy dance tunes that will have you moving. WB is made up of four members — Alex Chod on keyboard and vocals, Butch Wade on the drums, Colton Hardin on the guitar, and Corey Fitzgerald Spears on the bass. This album was recorded at a home studio with the assistance of Jet Jaguar of IDLE Productions and Mark Schroth of The Recording Conservatory of Austin. It features Adam Littman’s sexy saxophone on track 4 and was mastered by Jerry Tubb of Terra Nova Digital Audio, Inc. Now, on to the review! The album opens up with a high-energy combination of upbeat synth sounds and fast paced high hat action on the drums. The retro sounds resemble ones that you may have heard on a video game featuring an anthromorphic blue hedgehog that runs around collecting golden rings. (Did you catch that reference?) The first track titled “Beingness” is a canticle of grooviness that pulls you out of your head and on onto the dancefloor. It is an invitation of full presence' - Medium",

Ozturk’s Björk like vocals will instantly grab you as Fuji Kureta’s music ebbs and flows with soft beats and climatic runs. The entire EP has a tense undertone vibe which helps it stand out as their sharp electronic turns have the precision of Radiohead’s later era records. At times, Yetunde is like watching a drip of water release slowly and fall to the ground. You are never quite sure when it is going to detach but when it does an entire new energy is created.

Drippy synth licks slide upwards in the gaps left between bass beats, and the almost-inaudible words return to befuddle us yet again (something about “hard labor” and “flows through your blood”). The groove lasts for a while until the synth pads suddenly fade out to let a vocal sample shine through – “I’ll fucking blind you” is perfectly comprehensible, and the mix gets violent yet again. “CEO” (as previously premiered on No Smoking) is essentially a noir film soundtrack, a sharp left turn away from the chunky/artificial/glitchy sounds of the first two tracks. The violin melody is created artificially, sure, and a robot voice breaks up instrumental sections, but there’s still the curated sensation of being transported to a time where the synthesizer didn’t quite exist. The self-titled track brings us back to the altered EDM feels with synthesized tones that streak by in hard left/right pans, and we’re finally treated to a comprehensible vocal sample that sings melody over a pleasant groove ('you will find a better way – entertain').' - No Smoking Media",

The band’s whimsical everyday subject matter and Demakos’ laconic delivery struck a cord with audiences worldwide, and the tour dates followed. Over a star-studded ensuing year the band has toured the world, presenting the Blimp Rock message through music and PowerPoint in all the world’s finest cities: Paris, Peterborough, Berlin and Guelph. Sophomore Slump, the second Blimp Rock album, is being released to the public on April 7th, 2015. Investors have already begun clamoring for Blimp Rock Enterprises to take its stock public in anticipation of the release, which Demakos has promised will be “a real disappointment” compared to their first album. Featuring tributes to boys who cry during movies, conflict resolution over stolen pizza, and the anthemic single ‘Let’s All Stay in Tonight’, Blimp Rock captures the odds and emotional ends of real life on the ground... for now.' - CBC",

        "text": "Since our freshman decision that forming a record label might be a cool idea in 2010, the four years of college that followed were a learning experience that none of us could have predicted. The idea first emerged from lo-fi recording sessions with the anonymous artist who is Hypocrite in a Hippy Crypt as well as recording with Owen Yonce, multi-instrumentalist who started Bonfire John (and the Majestic Springs Band). As time went on and more music got recorded, it was a slow few years through sophomore and junior year in terms of developing any business sense whatsoever. Most of our efforts at that time went toward music, house shows, and partying. We collaborated with new artists though, some on opposite sides of the world, and eventually we built a steady roster. Early Junior year, we experimented with the surprisingly intricate process of connecting with the right people to press a vinyl. We awoke from drug ridden days and alcohol ridden nights late into our Junior year to find that we had nothing left to offer but our own recovery and the harsh realities of lessons learned. The release of Tweaker II, predecessor of Tweaker In The Park, was rough and the heart just wasn’t there, but we shared with the world our first record.…now only a few months after graduation, and just as 4 more years begin for the next lucky suitors to carry the torch of college life, we are planning our second vinyl titled, College. The tracks were recorded over the span of about 4 years that we were in school and throughout central Indiana, and we’re excited to have something that we feel is honest, intrinsic, dynamic, and jam packed with integrity.",

Jon Dice is the project of Jeff Pupa started in 2008 after returning to the East Coast from Alaska. The project is an ever-changing endeavor through sectors of EDM. Jeff is also the vocalist and guitarist for dream-noir band, Vows. All of his work has been produced in an 'archaic' home studio which consists of a macbook, a Tascam Portastudio III, a 4-in-1 record player, and a Shure 58 microphone. Jon’s first project, an EP entitled ‘Climaxxx’ was released back in 2008. It was a confused and 'dirty dark acid' house sound, a quiet home-recorded release. His first full length album, ‘Soak’, was released in 2009 which was more of a funk dance project. His music continues to evolve over time, as he tries new sounds and samples from different genres to create a style that’s all his. To get an idea of his style, Jon is influenced by several artists including, Burial, Boards of Canada, Madlib, Flying Lotus and Aphex Twin.' - First Ear",

Once the percussion comes in the track takes on a much more accessible personality as the lurking synths suddenly have a bit of a groove to them, and guitars also contribute some nice little licks too. Vows’ introduction is a well layered sound with all kinds of rhythm and a finale that is easily one of the most gorgeous endings to a song I’ve heard this year. Excellent."

        "text": "The album encompasses an artistic experience for both myself and the people around me. Rather than writing songs about ideas, I focused on composing during the development of ideas. From the 21 years of life that I have not only enjoyed, but also in many instances endured, I found, as I believe most do, that many of my life perspectives had untied ends. We all search for answers, and especially certainty in life. Each song stems from an idea or perspective that I felt as a 20 year old in 2012, needed further examining or expanding. The album took up the past 2 years of my life as I spent segments of time dedicated to each track and the ideals it carried. As the ideals formed new and more complete meaning, so too did the songs. Many of the tracks encompass a change from start to finish, and many of them simply hold the perspective and depth of the ideal itself. The album as a whole was written in order from beginning to end. My conclusion…The only bad people in the world are those who try to control someone other than themselves. And if you can’t control yourself, you won’t find peace. Everyone is conscious and aware of the same things you are. Down with Machines.",

If you listen closely you will be able to identify me as a person and not just a name. This is my first album ever so I put all that I have into it. I called it ‘Dance Floor Secrets’ because of the inspiration I got from my grandma who passed 5 years back as she could dance to any song I was playing. It didn’t matter whether it was hip-hop, house, electro, she danced to every song. Getting that from her I was able to create this album which has different sounds and different genres put in one album with a bit of my taste too. Every person should be able to identify his taste or favorite song somewhere in this album, and there should be something for everyone here.' - EAZY",

        "text": "Replacing much of the acoustic guitar from the first release with electric, Tweaker Two still feels sparse, although the sound is heavier this time around. Opening song “If/Then” is a slow-burner, building from a spare electric guitar hook and vocals that exude bitter wit through cause and effect wordplay. “Freak Me Out” sounds like Nirvana if they had grown up listening to The Zombies instead of Black Flag. The album’s closer, “They Missed It,” combines intricate guitar work, cryptic lyrics, steadily building backbeats and underlying pop melodies. Tweaker Two is certainly more somber than its predecessor, however, it also showcases an artist who has learned to mature while honing his song-writing skills.",

Luckily we dodged that bullet and stayed dry, and the next day Yonce was off on a trek across the country to rock climb, hike, roam canyons, and make familiar the rural landscapes that can sometimes be overshadowed in this modern America.
