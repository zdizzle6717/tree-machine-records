Having produced rap music for years, Austin found himself bored and unhappy with the music he\’s made; wanting something more out of the talents he\’s acquired over time.",

            "Blimp Rock is an innovative music cooperative with one simple goal: to purchase an airship and host the world’s first blimp-based music festival over Lake Ontario, through the sale of easy listening rock. On behalf of parent corporation Blimp Rock Enterprises, Blimp Rock frontman Peter Demakos writes simple tunes that hearken back to a simpler era – a time when hydrogen was loved and not feared for its combustible properties.",
            "First market tested in 2013 with the release of self-titled album Blimp Rock, Blimp Rock’s comedic indie rock was a surprise success for Blimp Rock Enterprises, easily outpacing their previously top-performing investment in Rolodex futures. The band’s whimsical everyday subject matter and Demakos’ laconic delivery struck a cord with audiences worldwide, and the tour dates followed. Over a star-studded following year, the band has toured the world, presenting the Blimp Rock message in all the world’s finest cities: Paris, Peterborough, Berlin and Guelph."

            "Co-Manager, producer, beatmaker, and DJ from Johannesburg, South Africa, EAZY started his musical adventure at an early age. Born into a family of music lovers, he quickly developed a love for the sounds of Golden age hip-hop, Kwaito, underground, and house music. As his family was always playing various genres around him, he grew to love and understand the power and energy of music. He started out writing at the early age of 10, moved on to dancing, and soon started making beats and producing. EAZY started composing tracks at 15 and around that time got involved with local artist which progressed to international collaborations with independent artists including Jboo Tha Bully, PEchi , Juzmi and many more. Releasing mixtapes with friends lead to forming a production duo with Blayze Deville called The Virtuosos. Together they took over the local scene by producing singles and mixtapes. EAZY also now DJ\’s anything along the lines of deep tech, electro, techno, deep house, electronic, and dub step. With his ability to entertain the crowd and read their emotions, he\’s always able to make sure the crowd keeps moving. His genre specific versatility gives him the ability to switch and mix sounds on the decks that keep the crowd entertained with “his dirty bass music” leaving the crowd always wanting more of what he has to offer. EAZY is a true force to be reckoned with and he is a true entertainer now leading the development of the electronic side of Tree Machine Records from across the Atlantic.",

It has a quality much more akin to the lazy, balladic guitar moments of the late ‘50s and early ‘60s.

                "Pony formed in 2009 and released their official debut album the same year. They began as a post punk band and quickly gained notoriety from various Korean media outlets and fashion magazines. Tiring of the rock scene and their image\’s association with fashion, the band moved towards a more shoegazing, noise pop sound; releasing their ep, Little Apartment, in 2012. During this time they were featured by Fred Perry Subculture and released two music videos with the brand. Soon after they decided to stop all activities and took a three-year hiatus. They soon returned with their 2nd album, signing with TM Records.",

            "Shorebilly is the project of self-taught multi-instrumentalist and producer Rémi Alexandre playing guitar, bass and keyboard alongside various artists and bands such as Syd Matters, H-Burns, Mellow, etc. When speaking of artists that influenced him, Rémi mentions François de Roubaix\’s elegance, melodic evidence and taste for sound experiments, and Dennis Wilson, dark accursed surfer and outsider Beach Boy. He admires multi-instrumentalist Todd Rundgren for his work as a producer and his soulful writing. He also mentions his friends and spiritual fathers, the members of french touch band Mellow, who passed on to him a true passion for production. And eventually Syd matters band leader Jonathan Morali with whom he shared ten intense years on the road.",
            "His debut 6 track record 'WipeOut!' is a colorful collection of songs that lead Rémi to confront himself musically, and apply his production skills to a personal project. The production is condensed, precise, focused on groove and melody, with an ambition to move listeners, as well as make them move. Behind his intricate writing lies pure stylistic freedom, and a will to brake all aesthetic and conceptual barriers. This ep was written and recorded as spontaneously as possible to avoid getting lost in long and complicated thought process. Shorebilly composes a singular and sincere music fit for all sensibilities, a hectic yet organic soundscape where pop and electronic music collide. Rémi Alexandre constantly pumps life and emotion into a synthetic universe of his own creation. This passionate and thin-skinned workaholic has decided to surf his own wave and 'Wipeout!' is his declaration of love for music.",

            "Vows’ debut album Winter’s Grave arrived to NPR folded carefully in a worn piece of paper xeroxed with hand-drawn artwork. True to it’s packaging, Winter’s Grave is delicately hand-crafted rather then sloppily home-spun. Vows is a dreamy, atmospheric band with pop sensibilities from a small town in New Jersey. The album’s title track has a satisfying blend of enchanting and eerie sounds. It opens with a vibrant riff that rattles over synth keys but slips into dissonant, creepy organ sounds. In an email, lead vocalist Jeff Pupa explains that the song was inspired by his experiences with travel, particularly a trip to Alaska after his college graduation: It’s sort of an anthem/pep rally song for the idea of soul-searching. Maybe you leave and find nothing, maybe you return to where you started, but either way you’ve got the visuals of mammoth land and soundscapes surrounding you.' – NPR",
            "'This music is an altogether different take on Americana but it rightfully takes its place alongside more conventional forms. In the future though, This music will inevitably become a convention in itself and be marked out as being as quintessentially American as Hank Williams or The Beach Boys. Vows are part of that evolution of form and only they have any clue where it will take them. They are holding the map.' – Fresh Tracks"

            "In the winter of 2012, Wonderbitch sprouted from a fertile galaxy of childhood friends and numerous stagnant projects in Bloomington, Indiana. Those in the cluster ready to break the heavy orbit of their liberal college town brought together their sounds- psychedelic, spiritual and progressive- and began to groove their way south (like a dancing starburst of sass) to Austin Texas, home of infinite gigs and the love of love.",
            "From a weighty foundation of Pink Floyd, Genesis and Muse, Wonderbitch wraps up cool Steely Dan musicality with the danciness of Franz Ferdinand and the nostalgic sheen of smooth mid 80s pop. Wonderbitch currently writes, records and performs in Austin as they continue to cultivate their show into a lovingly explosive and enveloping experience to bring to stages large and medium.",
            "Wonderbitch harnesses the transportive power of rock to take listeners on sophisticated flights of fancy. Citing psychedelic and 80s pop influence on their sound, they enchant with the visual aspects of their intriguing music videos and spirited live performances.",
            "Traces of Bowie, Steely Dan, and Talking Heads decorate their tunes. Lyrically, their offerings wax New Age, yet the sound is mixed in the charred, weirder edges of alternative. Their whimsical songs explore starkly rendered feelings and subjects that allow them to resonate with an introspective but universal vibe."

            "'Born of the New Jersey music scene, WOOF is the latest project to grasp electronica inspired indie-pop by the metaphorical balls and swing it towards the ceiling of otherworldly goodness. Signed to Tree Machine Records, the project belongs to multi-instrumentalist Kelan Bonislawksi, who after years of artistic rambling found he could play enough instruments to effect the sound of a full band. The rest, as they say, is history.' – Drunken Werewolf",
            "'Two guitars interlock nicely, weaving scales together and keeping the energy high, beefed up by a chugging bass. Bonislawski appears to get a bit antsy playing the 4/4 drum beats the genre requires, so just for fun he includes a staggering amount of fills and surplus beats not seen since the likes of Tre Cool or Travis Barker. Hints of New Found Glory mesh with The Foo Fighters, SR-71, and that one 90s song your friend’s boyfriend did at karaoke last week to create a whole that’ll get your head nodding, but won’t get your arms uncrossed.'",

That being said, this track is also pitch-perfect for this opening montage, which concludes with Nick rolling up to school, just in the 'Nick of Time' (also film's title). Detention averted!

Following the first EP, 5 EPs have been released, including 'Lens Flares' and the track 'Palimpsest' (featured on soundcloud's homepage for a few weeks). You Are Number Six composes his music using real instruments (guitar, bass, keyboard) and drum machines; he produces his own mix, and also works on artwork and an interactive web site.",
